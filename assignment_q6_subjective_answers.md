## Magnitude of theta v/s degree for different N

1. Here I took the log(max(theta)) in y-axis and degree in x-axis

2. The Graph with N=240 :

3. The Graph with N= 120:

4. The Graph with N= 80:

5. The Graph with N= 60: 
    
    > ![alt text](q6_4.png "DS")

Here we can see that Theta value increases as N decreases, showing that its over fitting
